    <p class="lead" style="margin:0;">
      My research broadly deals with how precipitation systems form, evolve, and impact the general public. This spans 
      <strong>cold-season orographic convection</strong> contribution to precipipation over complex terrains in arid regions and
      <strong>West African rainfall regimes</strong> linked to flood risk. I blend observations,
      convection-permitting and LES modeling (WRF/MPAS), and climate-model ensembles to connect
      process-level dynamics with practical forecasting and adaptation.

    <section>
      <h2 style="text-align:left;">Precipitation processes: from microscale to large-scale</h2>
      <p style="margin:0;">
        A core theme is disentangling how stability, gravity waves, terrain-forced lifting, and
        microphysics organize convection and control precipitation efficiency across scales.
        I use nested WRF (2.7 km → 900 m → 100 m) and targeted observations to follow the
        lifecycle of and identify convective cells embedded in stratiform clouds.

    <section>
      <h2 style="text-align:left;">Convective storms in km-scale climate model simulations</h2>
      <p style="margin:0;">
        I evaluate how well km-scale models represent convective organization and storm dynamics,
        using process-oriented diagnostics and satellite/radar constraints. This includes a
        detection algorithm for CESC and sensitivity-aware metrics that scale to seasonal
        climatologies and forecast post-processing.

    <section>
      <h2 style="text-align:left;">West African rainfall regimes, extremes, and flood potential</h2>
      <p style="margin:0;">
        I analyze seasonal features like the Little Dry Season (LDS) and quantify heavy-precipitation-induced
        flood (CHP) potential using multi-index diagnostics with CMIP6 ensembles and CHIRPS validation.
        Results inform adaptation for urban flooding and water management.
